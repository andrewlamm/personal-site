I was also a teaching assistant for <OutsideLink href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122-archive/s23/">15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation</OutsideLink> last semester as well.
              The Computer Science topics that interest me the most currently are web development, programming languages, and computer systems. Outside of class, I enjoy gaming and relaxing.

              I really enjoy helping people, and many of my projects are designed to help people with certain tasks. A couple summers ago, I helped pioneer a website that taught the basics of web development for a web development class at my high school. Additionally, during my senior year, I worked on a project that improved the school's course catalog to aid students in their course selection process. Also, I volunteered as a beginning Java teacher at my local Chinese school and taught introductory Java topics to middle school students every week for a year.

              I graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in 2022 with a 4.51 GPA. In high school, I took many advanced courses including Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, AP Computer Science with Data Structures, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Advanced Math Techniques, and AP Physics C. During my senior year, I was the statisician for my school's <OutsideLink href="https://tjcsec.club/">Computer Security Club</OutsideLink> and helped host <OutsideLink href="https://tjctf.org/">TJCTF</OutsideLink>, a CTF consisting of over 1100 players and over 300 teams. Additionally, I marched trumpet for my school's marching band for all four years and volunteered to be a quartermaster for three.
